title: Blog reboot. Again.
---

This blog has been silent for a long time. More than three years, in fact. And I don't know yet whether anything about this silence will change in the foreseeable future. I've run a short-lived experiment on Tumblr because I felt like I wanted to share stuff in a way that would make it accessible to people who are not present on Facebook as well. But since content posted on Facebook with third-party tools is rendered differently from stuff that's posted directly (wonder why...), I ended up posting things using Facebook's page and app again. 

Now, a technical upgrade of the underlying WordPress installation of this blog was more than overdue. And I would have just killed the blog if it weren't for the domain itself and for a few posts I'd like to keep online. So I decided to steer a middle-way: I dropped Wordpress in favor of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (which generates a static page offline) and removed all other dynamic parts of the page, including the picture gallery. This way, no annoying server-side software upgrades are required anymore, I can host the page almost anywhere and, most importantly, I don't have to worry about security holes in third-party PHP code anymore. The only compromise here is [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), which is a SaaS commenting system.

Content-wise I cleared out the posts down to a bare minimum of items that I still find interesting in any way. Whether and what kind of new posts I will add in the future...I don't know. But at least, lunikon.net still leads somewhere.
