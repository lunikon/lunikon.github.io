<p>The third week in Hong Kong is almost over. My opinion of the city hasn't changed a bit, I'm still absolutely fascinated by it and I'm enjoying my stay a lot. But of course I'm here to study and not for (pure) fun. Classes slowly started last week and with the tutorials which commenced this week aswell one could say the full program is up and running. So far I'm enrolled in 5 subjects which will cover most of the things I have to do to get this semester approved by my home university including some subjects from the seventh semester. To make it perfect I will probably try to take a sixth class as well since this way I won't have to catch up on anything when I'm back in Elsfleth. This of course means a lot of work: Me and my fellow students are already covered with readings and reports for several weeks, a further subject will most likely increase this amount of work considerably. It seems like the system at our university is very much focused on quantity. While lectures are easy to follow (not to say boring sometimes) and in my opinion could cover far more material, &quot;coursework&quot; is probably meant to compansate for this by simply being &quot;a lot&quot;. Usually every subject has a tutorial. In those tutorials teamwork assignments seem to be very common. In almost all of my tutorials some kind of these tasks were given so far and in most cases they make up a considerable share of the final grades. Overall I'll be spending a whole lot of time reading papers and researching on the internet but let's see how it turns out. It is quite a difference to Elsfleth though...that's for sure.</p>
<p>But when talking about work there are other issues to be taken care of aswell...to be exact there are about 15 of them waiting in the bugtracker of AirlineSim ;). Most of them are smaller cosmetic problems which should be done in no time. On the other hand there are still some major issues concerning the passenger behaviour. Fixing those, especially with the given situation stated above, will eventually take some more time to do. We are in process of working on patch 1.3.3 and we will see how many improvements will find their way into this just as the available time allows us to. Marcus is currently taking a look at the traffic rights which tend to cause some trouble right now so we hope to be able to present a fix for this as soon as possible, too.</p>
<p>And a little hint at the end: I've just <a title="Pictures from the city orienteering tour" href="http://www.lunikon.net/gallery/main.php/v/ImpressionsfromHongKong/Cityorienteering/">uploaded another 30 pictures</a> from Hong Kong, so have a look ;)</p>
