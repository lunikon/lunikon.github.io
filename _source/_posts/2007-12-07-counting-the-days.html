<p>Yep, it's been a while since new material appeared in this location but somewhat I didn't feel like writing too much lately even though plenty of stuff to write about would've been available. I still didn't write about my trip to Japan...shame on me. Anyway, today I attended the very last lecture of this semester. Just four exams left until some time before christmas and this will be it. Unbelievable how time went by, especially November. Nils and I are still thinking about where we could travel in January because we have plenty of time until our scheduled departure from Hong Kong. But somewhat we are lacking the necessary motivation and are not very decisive when it comes to picking the destination. (Northern) China is too cold, diving in the Philippines is not valuabe enough in a cultural sense and all the other countries surrounding us are too exotic for us wimps to dare. But oh well, we'll see. Recommendations are very welcome, so in case you know a place you always wanted to see photos of, just let us know ;). </p>
<p>Another small thing that might be interesting to some of you: Today I did what Hong Kong is known for best to many people...I ordered a tailor-made suit. Measures were taken today, first try-on will be on monday and the whole thing will be finished some days later. I'm really anxious to see the results next week. Mark and Norman already ordered theirs a few days earlier and had their first try-on today. The difference between a regular of-the-shelve suit and a custom made one is very obvious. The package will include the suit, a shirt and an additional pair of trousers...for the price of my current suit which I bought back in Germany last year. They will keep my measures and whenever I need a new suit I can reorder one and they will ship it to any place I need it at. As soon as I see the results I will let you know about it. Chances are you come by HK some day and need one too ;).</p>
