<p>I wanted to redo my blog for quite a while now and today I finally got to do it. The primary objective was to switch the system from Serendipity to Wordpress. We're using the latter with <a href="http://www.airlinesim.aero">AirlineSim</a> and it really grew on me while Serendipity was more of a hassle although I'm everything but a heavy user.</p>
<p>Along came a new theme. I looked around the web for several hours searching for one that was easy to modify, as I wanted the new design to resemble the look of the old one and at the same time to take it a few steps further. Because I really wasn't in the mood for CSS hackery today I settled with this professional but less customized template. I might switch to another one in the future in case I finally come across a good one I like.</p>
<p>Since I'm often switching between languages here, I tagged all posts with the language they are written in. To list all posts available in your preferred language, simply click DE or EN in the tag cloud on the right. After doing so you can also subscibe to an RSS feed based on that tag.</p>
<p>Please let me know what you think.</p>
