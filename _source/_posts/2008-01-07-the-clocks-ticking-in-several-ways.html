<p>Yes, I admit, it has been fairly quiet around here over the last couple of weeks. And since a few people were complaining about this silence I'll use this first post of year 2008 to get everybody reading this up-to-date about what's currently planned and going on. Hopefully all of you had a merry Christmas and went well into the new year. I spent the holidays with my family and girlfriend in Hong Kong, managing to actually gain some (too much) weight although there were hardly any large, tasty and rich family meals as it's usually the case when spending Christmas at home. Let's just blame it on the candy...or the muscle mass gained while wandering around the city in a true touristic fashion. Anyway, I'm back to the gym now and my last days in Hong Kong go by.</p>
<p>That should be enough of the personal stuff though. Now that my family, my girlfriend and even my roommate left, one might think there should be plenty of time to get some work done. And as I never found a way out of my motivational dive cruise I can't see myself spending much time travelling in the very near future either. Perfect conditions to rot in front of the screen...and in fact, after I wasted yesterday by bringing malaria pills to the airport (thanks Mark :-P), today I officially started the work on the next major version of AirlineSim, namely 1.4. Don't get too excited...not a single line of code has been hacked in so far. We're having so many features, changes and improvements in mind for this milestone that the first thing to get done was some organizing. The result was a rough list of about 30 topics basically covering every aspect of the game in some way or the other. It contains mostly changes that will be applied to existing functions but there are also some brand new features on it which I will leave in the dark as of now of course ;). Still, you should be able to imagine that a whole bunch of work will come along with this wishlist and I expect it to have grown to easily above 200 tasks after we went into the details. Actually it feels like at the beginning of a totally new project whenever I look at this pile of stuff to get done. Unfortunately all this will have to take place under heavy time constraints as I will only have about one month of spare time before my internship with <a href="http://www.agilitylogistics.com">Agility Logistics</a> starts in March. Naturally I'll spend this time with my girlfriend to a large extend so we will have to see how AirlineSim can squeeze in. Either way I reckon that several months will pass until this major release will see the light of the day. And seriously...I can't wait for it :)</p>
