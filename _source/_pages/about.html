<p>My name is Martin and I tend to call myself a self-educated software developer. Currently located in Giessen, Germany, I make a living running the online airline simulation game <a href="http://www.airlinesim.aero">AirlineSim</a>.</p>
<p>This blog is about...well...anything. I don't write about anything in particular and quite often I don't write at all. Chances are that many posts will deal with AirlineSim, good films I watched (usually I don't write about the bad ones), computer gaming and software development in general, occassional ramblings about the world we live in and all the toys adults tend to spend their money on.</p>
<p>Usually I write the posts in English, but every now and then there are things that are really only relevant to my German readers. Therefore I've tagged all posts with the language they are written in (<a href="http://www.lunikon.net/tags/de/">deutsch</a>, <a href="http://www.lunikon.net/tags/en/">english</a>).</p>
