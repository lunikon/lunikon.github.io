<p>As you might have figured this is the first post on this blog penned<br />
in English. Since everyone and everything is done in English over here<br />
and I want my new friends to be able to read my babbling, English will<br />
be the language of the Hong Kong category on this site. But enough of<br />
this, let's get to my first report.</p>
<p>We (Nils, Mark and I) arrived<br />
yesterday after a quite pleasent flight on Finnair. I'd call their<br />
service &quot;scandinavian&quot;...meaning cold but efficient ;). But hey, I had<br />
the oppertunity to fly both on an almost brand new Embraer 170 and a<br />
virtually historic MD-11. The first had an impressive level of space<br />
for a plane of this size category, the latter was &quot;nice&quot; for nostalgic reasons<br />
but we actually had less seat space then on the regional plane.</p>
<p>The<br />
first thing that strikes you on leaving the plane and that gives you a<br />
hard time every day after as well is the, for my taste, extreme<br />
climate. Temperatures around 30 degrees are not that special, but<br />
combined with a humidity of around 80% or more you start sweating<br />
seconds after leaving air-conditioned rooms. Walking over longer<br />
distances is somewhat exhausting and the constant changes between icy<br />
chilled rooms and tropical outside don't really improve the experience.<br />
Anyways, I have to and will get used to it at some point in time I<br />
guess.</p>
<p>Enough about the weather tough. The city by itself is<br />
plain awesome. Something that I haven't experienced like this<br />
before...ever. First of all there is the scale: On the one hour<br />
bus-ride we left the impressive Hong Kong Airport, we came by parts of<br />
the huge harbour of Hong Kong (Emma Maersk or one of her sisters was<br />
sitting at the quay) and had a nice view over the bay filled with ships<br />
of all sizes. As a European you'd probably call this sight &quot;chaos&quot; but<br />
everything seemed to work just fine. On crossing the city limit of<br />
Kowloon one has to be stunned by social differences that are both<br />
extreme and obvious: Right next to modern office buildings with<br />
mirrored windows and dozens of stories you find run-down houses in<br />
horrable conditions. All mixed up without clearly seperated districts<br />
or slums. Also quite unfamiliar is the &quot;3-dimensionality&quot; of the city.<br />
Neither Walkways, roads or train tracks are limited to a single level.<br />
Everything crosses from underground to plain level to elevated. You<br />
might enter a mall over a door in the second level and leave it to the<br />
underground. Besides that you can walk across the whole city without<br />
ever leaving covered walkways...which is a really good thing since<br />
walking in the sun is unbearably hot and strong rain showers can occur<br />
at any time.</p>
<p>Well, I'm writing too much again. I will continue<br />
writing at some other point in time. Just that everybody knows: I<br />
arrived just fine, the city is great, we made new friends fast and<br />
easily and we're having a lot of fun and a great time. Next time I got<br />
to tell you about Hong Kong high tech and our first experiences with<br />
Hong Kong nightlife.</p>
