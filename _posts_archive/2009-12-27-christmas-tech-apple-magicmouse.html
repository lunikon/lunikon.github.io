<p>Christmas - for a nonbeliever like me anyway - largely consists of giving and receiving presents. And the major percentage of the presents I receive nowadays falls into the "tech" category. So I'll try to give a brief review of the new items that I'll have to replace again in two years down the road.</p>
<p>To begin with, my new mouse: The recently released MagicMouse from Apple. I've been a happy Microsoft IntelliMouse Explorer user for the last years. In fact I hardly saw the need to replace my mouse. So the reason I put the MagicMouse on my wishlist was primarily due to Apple's excellent marketing...and the fact that I really enjoy the MacBook's multi-touch functionality which Apple has now added to a seperate input device for the first time.</p>
<p>Like with every new mouse, the first thing that feels awkward is the size and shape of the new tool. The MagicMouse is no different in this respect as it's considerably smaller than the Explorer and it will take me a few days to completely adjust. Also, since the total of the mouse's shell is a single button, it feels strange to do a "click" because the whole thing appears to be moving. At this point I got to say that Apple could have put more emphasis on making the click a little less noisy. Somewhat similar to the multi-touch mouse-pad of the new MacBooks, which is a button too, the click is very loud compared to other mice. The "scratching sound" when moving the mouse over the table surface is comparable to that of the Explorer while any sound when scrolling is obviously nonexistant with multi-touch gestures (a noticable issue of the latest IntelliMouse Explorer).</p>
<p>That said, the most important feature of the MagicMouse of course are the touch gestures. Scrolling in all directions feels extremely natural because all you have to do is slide around with your finger. This is extremely useful for web pages with horizontal scroll bars (why do those exist, anyway?) and appears to be a good replacement for the MightyMouse's scroll ball which apparently caused quite some trouble after extensive use. A two-finger swipe left or right allows to navigate forward or backward, primarily through your browser history. This is extrememely useful, especially since I learned to love this feature while still working under Windows with an Explorer mouse (which had buttons on the side mapped to these functions) and then missing this functionality under OS X due to bad driver support.</p>
<p>So overall I'm quite happy with the device so far. It's the first wireless device I ever used as I'm very sceptical about having a mouse dependant on a battery, so it will be interesting to see whether the MagicMouse can change my opinion on those in general. When back in my own place I'll try to write a few lines about the other important piece of tech I found under the tree this year.</p>
