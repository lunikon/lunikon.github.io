<p>Dank Bennet bei <a href="http://www.bash.org/?714706" title="Original bei bash.org">Bash</a> gefunden:
<p><i>&lt;Buck&gt; the MPAA site has an interesting anti piracy blitz going on for Christmas<br />
&lt;Buck&gt; they say that they're protecting users from buying pirated copies of films<br />
&lt;Buck&gt; then they go on to say that you can recognize pirated<br />
films by the fact that they're a lot cheaper, out before or while films<br />
are still in theatres, are region free and contain no DRM<br />
&lt;Buck&gt; if I wouldn't have pirated before.. the MPAA sure has convinced me to do it now</i></p>
<p>Da ist auf jeden Fall was dran...trotzdem bleib ich beim Original ;)</p>
