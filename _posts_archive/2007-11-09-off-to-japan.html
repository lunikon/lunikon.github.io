<p>As mentioned a few days ago I'm off to Japan tomorrow. So hopefully<br />
nothing serious happens while I'm gone...especially concerning<br />
AirlineSim. But my <a href="http://mutantenstadl.de/">favourite admin</a> and the other programmers will take care of any problems I guess ;)</p>
<p>Unfortunately the payment of our flight to Beijing is still up in the air although we have tried two different websites now. Obviously there is something wrong with Nils' and my credit cards even though the bank claims everything should be working just fine. Anyway, Nils has to take over now since I'll be out of reach for some days. I hope we get this stuff booked somehow...otherwise we'll probably have to stay in Hong Kong and actually do some studying :).</p>
