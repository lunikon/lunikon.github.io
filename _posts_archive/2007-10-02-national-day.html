<p>Yesterday was national day in China and therefore in Hong Kong as well. While the original occasion for this holiday is the founding of the Peoples Republic of China the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's &quot;return to the motherland&quot; was also celebrated. Many thousand people including us went to the harbour to see the corresponding fireworks. The firework consisted of 11 scenes, each with a different topic. I found it especially funny that they had a scene obviously dedicated to Harry Potter playing a variation of the movie's title song as well as clearly showing symbols from the films. Although it was very windy and because of that not all of the images looked quite as sharp as they were probably supposed to the fireworks were extremely impressive and worth watching. The size of the whole show was enormous and also very long (over 20 minutes). If you ever get the chance to visit HK at the first of October make sure not to miss this event.</p>
<p>Since Mark was the one taking pictures that night <a href="http://mark-thieme.blogspot.com/2007/10/nationalfeiertag.html">take a look at his blog</a> for impressions and (this time) even videos (unfortunately only in German).</p>
