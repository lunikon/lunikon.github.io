<p>One of the side-effects of being self-employed is being your own boss. Sounds obvious? I bet to most people the actual meaning of this isn't that obvious at first. As "the boss", the majority of your work usually consists of taking decisions. And in fact, as a self-employed developer of web-games you are the one who takes any decision their is to take since no single customer has the ability to actually influence your way of doing things unless you allow him to. Some will say this is heaven. To many other it's hell. For me it's a bit of both.</p>
<p>Today it was more of the latter though. Currently my primary occupation of course is AirlineSim - which includes many things beyond the development of the game itself like integrating and maintain payment methods, doing back-office stuff like accounting and statistics, troubleshooting urgent issues, helping out in user support, organizing events, reading the forums and plenty of communication with all kinds of stakeholders. Besides AirlineSim I'm also in the prototyping stage of our next game title and as it seems right now I might also be involved in a customer project some time soon. Oh, and every now and then I tend to have a private live to manage as well. In summary: Every day there are uncountable of new to-dos I have to add to my list, many of which are out of my control even though I'm the sole decision-taker.Â  The tricky thing isn't the mere execution of the tasks - most of them are usually trivial - but how to prioritize which tasks to complete first and which to postpone. This is where the boss-part of my job description comes in. On some days there are just so many things you have to think of that you are spending more time and energy on remembering and sorting them than on actually getting stuff done. There's nobody telling you what to do. The only one who can, may and will tell you what to do is yourself.</p>
<p>I used to keep a list of open to-dos on a single sheet of paper next to my screen. Every item had a classic check box which I'd manually tick whenever the respective task had been completed. Old-school, yes, but very satisfying. Usually I'd prepare a list of tasks for one, maybe two days in advance. Everything beyond that scope had to remain either in my head or in a random location outside of my skull. This works fine as long as you are a.) working on a single project with b.) clearly defined tasks (like programming feature X or fixing bug Y) and the occasional random stuff mentioned above. But now I also have to get started to get things done on "Game #2" which is a.) a second project and b.) is everything but "clearly defined". In fact, I'm not even sure whether the original concept I had in mind is what I want to pursue any further (which isn't necessarily a bad thing...ideas have to be evaluated and either be adjusted or dismissed).</p>
