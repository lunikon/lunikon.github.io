<p>I eloberated quite a bit on the heat issues plagueing my notebook lately. Well, this weekend the situation worsened considerably up to the point that the machine crashed under the slightest above-average load. Working on it was not possible anymore effectively so I decided to call up the local Asus service office. Contrary to my expectation the person on the phone spoke very good English and I had no trouble explaining my problem to him. He left a very qualified impression and I was confident that he actually understood what I was talking about (which is not always the case with today's service personell). Since it was saturday we arranged me to drop by on Monday to take a look at the notebook. So I went there and showed the problem to him. He wrote a receipt and told me it would take about 1 to 2 days, depending on the cause of the problem. And in fact, today, not even two full days later, I did the trip again and picked up my repaired machine. They exchanged the whole cooling unit and ran several tests on it to ensure the problem was actually gone. It didn't cost me a single cent and they never asked for a guarantee certificate, registration or whatsoever. The whole process was very quick, professional and unbureaucratic. </p>
<p>This of course is also due to the fact that everything's close together in Hong Kong. I just had to take the subway and drop by to hand in the notebook. I did not have to send it in by mail or anything similar. The service office was very small and you always talked to the same person which is a great feature to me. So thumbs up for Asus' support in Hong Kong. It was almost flawless!</p>
<p><i>PS: Now that I have a working, <a href="http://www.notebookcheck.com/Test-Asus-F3Jm.2206.0.html" title="F3Jm made 86%">well-graded</a> notebook at hand again this should put a (preliminary) end to my search for possible alternatives ;)</i></p>
