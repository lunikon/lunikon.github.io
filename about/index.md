## {{page.title}}

My name is Martin Simons and I'm a guy-with-a-business-degree-turned-software-engineer. Currently I live and work close to Darmstadt, Germany and I make a living running the small indie game studio [simulogics](https://simulogics.net).

### What's in the name?

I don't remember really. I think it is vaguely referring to a space program by a similar name, but the more important reason probably was the fact that back in the days, Google did not return any results for this particular term.

### What's this blog about?

This blog is about...well...anything. I don't write about anything in particular and quite often I don't write at all. Chances are that many posts will deal with AirlineSim, good films I watched (usually I don't write about the bad ones), computer gaming and software development in general, occasional ramblings about the world we live in et cetera.

It's likely that, if I come across an interesting link or article online, I will [tweet it](https://www.twitter.com/lunikon) instead of writing a lengthy blog post about it.
