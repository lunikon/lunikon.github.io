## {{page.title}}

My name is Martin Simons, and I'm a guy-with-a-business-degree-turned-software-engineer. Currently, I live and work close to WÃ¼rzburg, Germany, and I make a living running the small indie game studio [simulogics](https://simulogics.games).

### What's in the name?

I don't remember really. I think it is vaguely referring to a space program by a similar name, but the more important reason probably was the fact that back in the days, Google did not return any results for this particular term.

### What's this blog about?

This blog is about...well...anything. I don't write about anything in particular, and quite often I don't write at all.
